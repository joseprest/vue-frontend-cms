While legacy energy sources (gas, coal, nuclear, etc.) are relatively stable, renewable energies are highly variable creating much greater balance swings.<br><br>Demand response is a well-proven solution to reduce the energy demand when the supply cannot keep up. It allows to <b>down-size power grids</b> while maintaining continuity of service during peak demand. Currently, demand response programs cover about 3% of the load side. Used primarily by high-load industries (steel plants, hypermarkets, cement plants, etc.). Increasing the demand response coverage is a strategic topic for countries as each additional percentage point of world coverage <b>saves around 100B€ in power plants construction.</b> The financial and technical challenge of the energy transition pushes states to increase demand response incentives to expand the coverage ratio. Energy utilities and <a href=\"https://www.energyvortex.com/energydictionary/aggregator.html\" target=\"_blank\">aggregators</a> turn these incentives into increasingly attractive deals for energy consumers.<br><br><b>Two major factors can scale demand response offers:</b><ul><li>Minimal impact on the customer’s operations. To truly scale, there should be no impact at all.</li><li>Shortest return on investment. The ratio of (deployment cost) / (monthly value creation) is crucial.</li></ul><br><b>HVAC systems are the preferred loads for scalable demand response solutions because:</b><ul><li>They have high inertia (building masses, water loops, buffer tanks, cold rooms, among others) and can be operated as an energy battery with virtually no impact on the building occupants and operations.</li><li>They are high energy loads translating in sizeable demand response value creation.</li><li>The cost of the deployment with legacy solutions is very high. As an example, it costs 7.000€ for a 1.000m2 office building already equipped with a BMS or 21.000€ if there is no BMS. As stated by the French energy agency in 2017, this is a major limiting factor for demand response scalability.</li></ul>",
